The dataset is sourced from The Movie Database (TMDb) or similar datasets.
Key Features in the Dataset:

    Title: Movie title.
    Genres: List of genres associated with the movie.
    Keywords: Key terms representing the movie.
    Overview: A short description of the movie.

🛠 Installation

    Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MovieRecommenderSystem.git  
cd MovieRecommenderSystem  

Install required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt  

    Ensure the dataset is placed in the data/ folder.

🚀 Usage

    Run the Recommender System:

python recommender.py  

Input a Movie Title: Enter the name of a movie to get recommendations.

Get Recommendations: The system will display a ranked list of similar movies.

(Optional) Web Interface: If using Flask, run the web app:

    python app.py  

    Open the browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

📈 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing:

    Combine features like Genres, Keywords, and Overview into a single column.
    Tokenize and normalize text data using NLTK.

2. Vectorization:

    Use TF-IDF Vectorization to convert textual data into numerical feature vectors.

3. Similarity Calculation:

    Compute pairwise cosine similarity between movie vectors using:

    from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
    similarity = cosine_similarity(feature_matrix)

4. Recommendation:

    For a given movie, find the top-N most similar movies based on cosine similarity scores.

📊 Results

The system can recommend movies effectively based on the similarity of their features. Example:
Input: Inside Out
Recommendations:

 Up
 Running Forever
 Hoodwinked Too! Hood VS. Evil
 Envy
 Free Birds
